# Workday Scheduler

## Installation
No installation is necessary; view the deployed application by clicking on this [link.](https://a-westin.github.io/gtatl-05-workday-scheduler/)

## Usage
This is a very basic dayplanner-type application that utilizes jQuery and moment.js to allow users to add entries to timeblocks between the hours of a typical workday. Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether the current hour is past, present, or future. The app also stores the entries so that if the page is refreshed, the entries are still visible to the user. 

I think this app could be improved upon by making it a weekly or monthly calender and by including more than just the "standard" business hours, so that the app was had more functionality for users.

#### Credits

As always, W3schools.com was quite helpful, especially when I was looking into local storage. I also leaned pretty heavily on both the jQuery and moment.js documentation as they are extremely informative! I made the mistake of trying things on my own and ended up overcomplicating my processes more than I needed to. Once I combed through the documentation more thoroughly I realized why I had been having my specific issues!
